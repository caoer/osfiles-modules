# Codex — OpenAI Codex CLI. Prebuilt static musl binaries from GitHub releases.
# Pinned ahead of nixpkgs (which lags upstream). Bump: update version + both
# sha256 (nix-prefetch-url each tarball URL).
#
# Two tarballs per release: the CLI and codex-code-mode-host. Codex resolves
# the host beside its own binary and fails closed without it ("Code Mode is
# unavailable … host executable was not found").
